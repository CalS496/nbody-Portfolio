    It was fun running NBody.java with planets.txt and with other simulations/universe.
    All simulations ran fine, animations worked.

    My favorite was either "its-a-trap.txt" and "chaosblossom.txt"

    Was Not Required, But Still Did it for Fun:
    -Created a Test Script, "NBodyTestScript.sh" for fun
        More details about the Test Script can be found in the header of "NBody.java"

    -Inspiration from TA Josh:
       Included an alternative code of line for "2001.mid" on line 37
       //StdAudio.play("Sprach.wav");
       Plays the "horrible" version of 2001.mid.
       Mostly for fun
       Currently commented out and will not run with code, but can be used to switch
       with "2001.mid" for FUN.
